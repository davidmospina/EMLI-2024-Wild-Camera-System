    "Text": " The image shows a blackboard with the phrase \"THIS IS THE END\" written in bold, capital letters. The blackboard is propped up against a wall and is standing on its side, supported by two small objects that could be used to hold it upright or prevent it from falling over. The background is nondescript, featuring what appears to be a tiled floor and some furniture or storage units. The text on the blackboard suggests a humorous or ironic message, often associated with an unexpected conclusion or end of a task or project. "
