    "Text": " The image shows a person taking a selfie in a mirror with a smartphone. The person is wearing glasses and has short hair, facing away from the camera. Their reflection shows them looking into the phone's camera lens. Behind the person is a blank blackboard or board with no writing on it, indicating that it might be used for writing or drawing. The background also includes what appears to be part of a ceiling structure, suggesting this could be an indoor setting such as a classroom or office. "
